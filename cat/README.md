# Adventures in the Go Standard Library

Let's dive into the world of Go's standard library with the `bufio` package. This package delivers buffered I/O capabilities, improving the efficiency of reading and writing data. The attached code snippet uses `bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)` to read from standard input, allowing us to process data line-by-line. This is a simple, yet powerful example of how the bufio package can be utilized to replicate Unix's `cat` command in Go.
