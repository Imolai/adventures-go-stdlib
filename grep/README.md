# Adventures in the Go Standard Library

The `bufio` package in Go provides a robust interface for buffered writing. The `Writer` eases data transfer to an `io.Writer` object by providing a buffer, enhancing performance. If an error occurs, all subsequent attempts to write will return that error. Flushing post-data transmission ensures no data is left stranded in the buffer.
The example's simple Go program imitates basic functionality of Unix `grep` by searching for a regexp pattern in a text string. Therefore the stdlib package `regexp` is used here also.
